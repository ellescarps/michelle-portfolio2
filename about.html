        During my years in college, I collected a knowledge of interests within
        the creative arts. I enjoyed cinema and analyzing its content but
        discovered a love for theatre as I developed my study within its
        concentration. Theatre allowed me to become exposed to all works of
        different playwrights and composers from plays to musicals. I
        volunteered every evening and weekend to participating in backstage
        theatre. It allowed me to undertand how different departments involved
        themselves with each other in order to orchestrate an entire production
        in time for opening doors. I spent most of my personal time in
        stagecraft and lights. In stagecraft, we'd focus on constructing sets to
        scale and within the light deparment, I'd be assigned the spotlight to
        learn in order to operate it following noted cues for most of the
        musicals we staged. I floated around each department and assisted stage
        managers in a couple productions but I found my favorite spaces to
        collaborate in were within the stagecraft and organizing - as in stage
        managing and directing - departments.

        While studying abroad my first semester sophomore year in 2016, I took a
        creative writing class for the first time and found a love for creative
        writing. I've always excelled in research writing thanks to one high
        school English professor but never correlated it to fiction. It was in
        my creative writing class and workshops where the professor and
        classmates would express their love for my stye of writing. I was never
        aware that I had skill or style in writing so I was surprised every time
        it was pointed out. I didn't really consider it until we workshoped
        stories. I would take my laptop to the library and enjoy applying my
        imagination and creating a world from scratch. I honestly found
        enjoyment in how descriptive my writing could play out alongside a
        theasurus on hand.
