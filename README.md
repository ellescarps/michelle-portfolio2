# michelle-portfolio2

Hiii! I am a student and this is a practice project. I've created a first draft of a portfolio site that opens to three different pages so far: home page, about me page, and my portfolio page itself.

We haven't yet created projects of our own so there are placeholder contents in the meantime alongside cartoon images to set a vibe.

I've submitted code from each file to their respective branch from terminal to github.

I've added code each page to open up into one another in separate tabs but no content shows in those tabs that open? I will sort this out in Q+A either in class or at the next open support.

I will continue the progress of this project following the next set of instructions in our next class this week.

Thank you!!
